            <h3 class="introwords">
                <p class="intro1">Hello! My name is Zaylen Chase Reid Johnson! Most people who know me personally
                    call me Zaylen but people know me more commonly by Purpl3. I have three parts of my life that I would like to show off
                    and I think its easiest done by showing my names.</p>
                <p class="intro2">My first name was my legal name, Chase. This was what I went by through most of my childhood up till I
                    was around 16 or 17. This represents me being a young foolish firestarter that did everything while somehow also doing
                    nothing at all. I spread myself thin throughout this time with a lot of acheivments on paper to show for it but little
                    that carried any weight past that. When I reached adulthood I transitioned to going by Zaylen.</p>
                <p class="intro3">
                    When I grew up I was confused, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do and jumped around career path to career path until
                    I was 23. Thats when I enrolled in Coding Temple. Before that I got accepted to muliple schools for politics (including Oxford
                    University... r.i.p. my visa getting denied), astronomy / astrophysics while I interned at NASA for a few years, I was in
                    school to be a science / math teacher, I even played soccer at against junior olypians until my lungs gave out. All that 
                    I honestly care little about, what I do care about is the amazing group of people that I happily get to call my friends and, 
                    at this point, my family and the moments and hobbies I share with them.</p>
                <p class="intro4">
                    Now I need to talk about 'Purpl3', sometimes called 'Th3OnlyPurpl3'. This is what I am called by my 42.5 thousand and counting
                    followers on tiktok call me. Given my background I talk about a lot of stuff, my personal life, political takes, LGBTQ+
                    issues, sometimes little science things I see, anything that my followers recommend for me, everything I feel like. I've
                    done my best to cultivate a respectful community around me. It is fun but having that many people hang off your words can
                    definetly be exhausting. My cousin will ask me at every family gathering if it's weird and yes, it is very weird.</p>
