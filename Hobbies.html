        <img class="dndimg grow" src="Images\Dnd group.jpeg" alt="four of the five members of my dnd party, Adnik (top left), Randy (top right), Sheizo (bottom left), and Atan (bottom right)">
        <h3 class="dndinfo">
            The four caracters here are Adnik (top left), Randy (top right), Sheizo (bottom left), and Atan (bottom right), four of our
            party memebers as kids
            <br><br>
            Adnik was in school being picked on from the first day where he met his childhood best friend, and current will they won't they partner Ola.
            She helped him be seen as not weak like the others thought he was. Together now they work for the queen on a secret mission to send a letter
            across state lines.
            <br><br>
            Randy was a kid when his older brother, the only surviving one, tried his best to sheild him from his mother. He was playing outside on his
            birthday when he heard yelling and his brother run out with a burnt arm. He promised Randy he would be back with a cake in a few days. He 
            never returned. He became a drunk like his mom and forgot his brothers name but never his face.
            <br><br>
            Sheizo was wondering the city streets looting and looking for scraps before he met Bartholumule. From then he hit another job where he accidently
            found his parents neglecting his sister in the house they set up. Leaving the money and food he took his sister to save her from the life
            that she was leading.
            <br><br>
            Atan was adopted into a monestary where he found himself being treated differently to the other kids cause of his demon blood. He never hurt them
            but they didn't like him being in their space so he secluded himself in a library. It wasnt till he proved himself to the adults there by
            reading a forbidden book filled with demon magic.
