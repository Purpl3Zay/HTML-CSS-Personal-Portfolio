        <h3 class="bodyinfo">
            My childhood was an interesting time in my life. I wasn't exactly able to fit in anywhere, but I was also able to fit in everywhere. I was
            even referred to as a 'chameleon who has no friends but is friends with everyone' by one of my teachers in school, though I wouldn't hear
            those words till much later. That stuck with me and I didn't understand why for a while till I thought about it. My parents were tired of
            kids but as I got older I started to understand more and more. I had a litany of older siblings, Steve, Micheal, Jason, Micky, Aaricka,
            Joey, and Bryce. I was the baby and the youngest. When I was born Steve was about to graduate High School, he might have even graduated
            at this point. Steve, Micheal, and Jason are technically my cousins who were raised in the same house. Micky and Aaricka half siblings from
            my father. Joey is my neighbor who was and is constantly over, so we just counted him, my nephews even call him uncle and I go on his family
            vacations with my parents and only full brother Bryce. Now to be clear we love them all the same and at no point will I, or any of them,
            accept that they aren't my real brothers and sister. I've cut people off for saying that, this is my family and I love them.
            <br><br>
            As a child I did a lot. I played a lot of soccer from when I was 6 to when I was 16, I was even good enough to be playing (and losing)
            against junior Olympians. Bryce and I started a nonprofit business called ReSynTech with a few of our friends where we recycled technology
            that would be thrown out and fill out landfills and leaking toxic materials. We even were able to provide computers to a group of young
            girls in Burkina Faso who were opening up all girl schools to help with the gender gap in their schooling. I volunteered at the GLCC, or
            the Gay and Lesbian Community Center in my area during my school. I even interned at NASA for a while, working in the Bhul Planetarium
            in Pittsburgh PA and running shows that I researched and, even sometimes, made myself. My personal specialty was. For a short while I worked
            in politics, I worked with people in my area to help with social media and even got into schools to pursue this. It was amazing but sadly 
            cut short due to the denial of my visa.
